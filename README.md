### üß¨ Focus Areas
- Genomic and transcriptomic data analysis  
- Multi-omics integration and variant interpretation  
- AI-assisted pipelines and model prototyping  
- Biological data visualization and reproducible research  
- Language systems, code generation, and educational tech  

---

### ‚öíÔ∏è What I'm Working On
- Curating GitHub-ready bioinformatics notebooks from real-world datasets  
- Designing interactive tools for language and biological learning (HUNNiE MVP)  
- Exploring RNA-seq pipelines, gene regulation, and resistance mechanisms  
- Creating portfolio-ready research based on genomics, AI, and public health  
- Synthesizing course-based work into research-grade projects
